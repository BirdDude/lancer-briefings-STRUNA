Born to ex-Lancers who decided to settle down after acquiring immense riches from their escapades, Blake grew up a well-off child on the planet of Mir, off the Sierra-Madre line. He never particularly excelled in anything as a student in the Academy save for some skill as a pilot, and preferred getting up to no good with the children of the hangar workers rather than go home and take piano lessons with his mom.

Blake attempted to run away numerous times throughout his adolescence in order to get away from his family but every time and without fail, he would black out before getting very far, always ending back up in the arms of his parents. Eventually, he gave up trying and submitted to his parents' insistence that he become a pilot just like them.

Blake found the pilot training incredibly difficult, but with perseverance and threatening comments from his family, he managed to pass and receive his license. Now, he spends his time picking up odd jobs on the frontiers of civilization and spending time on the side cataloguing alien life and messing around with tech.

Still some questions gnaw at him however; will his family drag him back again, and if so, when? And where exactly did his family get their immense fortune?
