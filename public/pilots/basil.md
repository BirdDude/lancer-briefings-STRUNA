## DOSSIER NOT FOUND

Came from a core world, family of academics. (Delgado-like)

Went to prestigious engineering college and grad school, researching technology, specifically communication systems, on a different core world.

Got kicked out of grad school:

    They were a bit burned out

    They got a bit too cocky

    They decided everyone needed a way to relax so they installed Tetris as a permanently open tab on every university owned device.

    The university didn't appreciate their sense of humor (Crowley thinks they take themselves way to seriously)

So now they are disillusioned with the world, and a bit scared to show their silly/sweet side.

They decided their next best option was to join the navy, and just wanted to be boots on the ground managing communication. But they are terrible with handheld weapons, so the navy decided the best thing for them would be to pilot a mech. Their first mech experience was bad -- they accidentally blew up half a hangar.

They avoided deployment as long as possible, and when a 'peaceful' 'no combat expected' mission came up, they figured it was their best bet. And if they didn't accept this one they were going to be put in charge of training new recruits on mech tech (read, forcibly made TA of CSCI 1300).

The first thing they do in the morning is "make the bed" by organizing shinies on the wall above the bed. Then they go get coffee. Sometimes they wake up by hearing Moth's alarm through the wall since their rooms are next to each other on the Rio.

Before expected combat, Crowley listens to hype music and does a couple practice hacking problems. 

They collect shinies and have shiny tiers: snacks are at the bottom of the shiny tier list. They express affection by sharing shinies:

    showing shinies

    giving snacks

    giving shinies

    accepting your shinies
